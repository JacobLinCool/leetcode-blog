[Leetcode 1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-area-of-a-piece-of-cake-after-horizontal-and-vertical-cuts/)

# 題目

You are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where:

* horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, and
* verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.
